# Introduction
**Notice! This project is in the beginning phase and is being developed as a hobby. If you decide to use this plugin, any feedback and suggestions are welcome.**

This project was started with the idea of bringing back the in-game economy with a valuable item like an emerald. The plugin adds various traders to the server that you can use on the server while playing.
